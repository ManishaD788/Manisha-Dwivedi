 <h2>Starry Night - Nightscape Study</h2>
 <img src="starry night.jpg" alt="Swirling night sky over a village — Starry Night inspired" width="600" height="400">
    <p>
      This piece is a <b>study</b> inspired by classic swirling nightscapes.
      The artist focused on <i>motion</i> in the sky and used layered brushwork to achieve depth.<br>
      Earlier drafts had a different foreground — <del>a plain field</del> — which was later replaced with a small village to add scale and story.

<h2>Water Lilies - Monet Series </h2>
<img src="water lillies.jpg" alt="Reflections of Clouds on the Water-Lily" width="600" height="400">
<p>
    In Ancient Egypt, the blue lotus water lily represented a <b>connection to the afterlife</b>and
    the creation of the world itself. The water lily was closely tied to the sun god Ra,
    as the flower opens with the sunrise and closes with sunset, 
    aligning with the cyclical nature of life.

<h2>Wheatfield With Cypresses</h2>
<img src="Wheat-Field-with-Cypresses-.jpg" alt="Wheat Field with Cypresses" width="600" height="400"
<br>
<p>
    Van Gogh painted several versions of A Wheatfield, with Cypresses during the summer of 1889,
     while he was a patient in the psychiatric hospital of Saint-Paul de Mausole, in the village 
     of St-Rémy in the south of France. A first version, which he described as a study, was 
     painted on site in late June 1889.

    <h2>Mona Lisa</h2>
    <img src="monalisa.jpg" alt="monalisa" width="600" height="400"<br>
    <p>
        The Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the <b>Virgin Mary</b>, 
        who was at that time seen as an ideal for womanhood.
